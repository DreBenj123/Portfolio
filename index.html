                <p>I was born in Wheeling, WV and moved to Charlotte when I was 19 in the summer of 2016.
                    That November I was diagnosed with a rare form of Cancer. 
                    I am proud to say that I am cancer free and fully recovered. 
                    I started working again in 2020 at a Wine Restaurant starting as a dishwasher and working my way up to lead line cook!
                    I wanted something more for myself though, so I enrolled in the NC State Software Development bootcamp.
                    10 months later I completed that course and earned my Software Development certificate. After a couple months on the job search I was contacted by a Digital Marketing Company
                    to do Website Quality Assurance. I was starting to excel in this role when I was unexpectedly laid off after just 4 months.
                    So here I am again on the job search, while I continue to build my skills as a Software Developer. Thank you for visiting my page!
